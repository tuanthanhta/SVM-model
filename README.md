The dataset I use here is a credit card default dataset from UCI machine learning repository. The dataset suggest that neural network is the best method here. But here I would like to use classification method like Logisitic regression, Decision Tree  or SVM (Support Vector Machine) to see how well the model do in predicting the result.  

Specificly, I use SVM here

SVM1 file is used to decide which model to use while the SVM file is the main file where model is built
